Done Web Site Design with HTML and Java Script.
Fast Go(The name kept for the site) is a product selling website .Fast Go sells furniture , gadgets and food .
In fast go we added fast go front page where it asks for sign in or login ,after login/signin it opens home page of fast go ,where it gives information about fast go. In home page we have there options (furniture, gadgets, food) so when we click we go to buying pages of three selling websites .
So in furniture website the products are shown with descriptions and there is option to add to cart , to choose quantity and purchase, the same goes to other two website.
